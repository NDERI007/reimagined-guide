# reimagined-guide

vite using express and mysql

#GOAL
A project that combines the above frameworks and database
Vite is perfect for this project because of HMR and is lightweight compared to NEXT_js
Express helps in finetuning skills for creating api's, we also got a chance to interact with axios on the frontend
mysql is pretty simple to use and connect to express and is also perfect for this case scenario, there's still more to learn as we make our db more scalable and flexible to accomodate more data
